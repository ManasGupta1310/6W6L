# Go

We go through the tour of Golang and attempt the exercises in between the blog. We came to know about:- 
- Basic syntax of Go 
- Packages
    ```go
    package main
    ```
- Import libraries and use their respective functions
    ```Go
    import "fmt"
    ```
    ```Go
    import "math"
    ```
- Interfaces 
- Concurrency
